Known Bugs:
* Size of the impact crater is hardcoded.
* Parts of the vessel can get stuck on the original surface.
* Deformation is only added when the whole vessel dies, single part explosions don't generate craters.
* Deformation persistence is deactivated, due to the unfinished deformation model.
